Description:
============

Accounts.java:
--------------
Static methods for getting information about Win32 accounts (users
and groups).
- list all domain users
- list all domain groups
- list all local or domain groups where a user belongs to
- get account by SID
- get SID of account
- get domain controller name
- get domain name

--------------
Static methods for reading and manipulating the Windows Registry.
Only String and DWORD values supported, but could be easily
extended.
- create key
- delete key
- delete value
- read value
- get all sub keys of a key
- get all values of a key
- set value
- check existence of value

Win32Service.java:
------------------
Abstract class to wrap a Win32 service. Derive from this class
to build your own service. Supports only one type of service and
startup, but could be easily extended.
- install service
- uninstall service
- start service
- stop service
- callback for service start request (onStart), should spawn a thread
- callback for service stop request (onStop)

TestService.java:
-----------------
Very simple example of an implementation of Win32Service.java.
Does nothing but starting and stopping (no "useful" work).
