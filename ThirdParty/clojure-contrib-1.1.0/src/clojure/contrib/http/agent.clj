(ns #^{:doc "Agent-based asynchronous HTTP client.

  This is a HTTP client library based on Java's HttpURLConnection
  class and Clojure's Agent system.  It allows you to make multiple
  HTTP requests in parallel.

  Start an HTTP request with the 'http-agent' function, which
  immediately returns a Clojure Agent.  You will never deref this
  agent; that is handled by the accessor functions.  The agent will
  execute the HTTP request on a separate thread.

  If you pass a :handler function to http-agent, that function will be
  called as soon as the HTTP response body is ready.  The handler
  function is called with one argument, the HTTP agent itself.  The
  handler can read the response body by calling the 'stream' function
  on the agent.

  The value returned by the handler function becomes part of the state
  of the agent, and you can retrieve it with the 'result' function.
  If you call 'result' before the HTTP request has finished, it will
  block until the handler function returns.

  If you don't provide a handler function, the default handler will
  buffer the entire response body in memory, which you can retrieve
  with the 'bytes', 'string', or 'stream' functions.  Like 'result',
  these functions will block until the HTTP request is completed.

  If you want to check if an HTTP request is finished without
  blocking, use the 'done?' function.

  A single GET request could be as simple as:

    (string (http-agent \"http://www.stuartsierra.com/\"))

  A simple POST might look like:

    (http-agent \"http...\" :method \"POST\" :body \"foo=1\")

  And you could write the response directly to a file like this:

    (require '[clojure.contrib.duck-streams :as d])

    (http-agent \"http...\"
                :handler (fn [agnt] 
                           (with-open [w (d/writer \"/tmp/out\")] 
                             (d/copy (stream agnt) w))))

(def *http-agent-defaults*
     {:method "GET"
      :headers {}
      :body nil
      :connect-timeout 0
      :read-timeout 0
      :follow-redirects true
      :handler buffer-bytes})

(defn http-agent
  "Creates (and immediately returns) an Agent representing an HTTP
  request running in a new thread.

  options are key/value pairs:

  :method string

  The HTTP method name.  Default is \"GET\".

  :headers h

  HTTP headers, as a Map or a sequence of pairs like 
  ([key1,value1], [key2,value2])  Default is nil.

  :body b
  
  HTTP request entity body, one of nil, String, byte[], InputStream,
  Reader, or File.  Default is nil.

  :connect-timeout int

  Timeout value, in milliseconds, when opening a connection to the
  URL.  Default is zero, meaning no timeout.

  :read-timeout int

  Timeout value, in milliseconds, when reading data from the
  connection.  Default is zero, meaning no timeout.

  :follow-redirects boolean

  If true, HTTP 3xx redirects will be followed automatically.  Default
  is true.

  :handler f

  Function to be called when the HTTP response body is ready.  If you
  do not provide a handler function, the default is to buffer the
  entire response body in memory.

  The handler function will be called with the HTTP agent as its
  argument, and can use the 'stream' function to read the response
  body.  The return value of this function will be stored in the state
  of the agent and can be retrieved with the 'result' function.  Any
  exceptions thrown by this function will be added to the agent's
  error queue (see agent-errors).  The default function collects the
  response stream in a memory buffer.
