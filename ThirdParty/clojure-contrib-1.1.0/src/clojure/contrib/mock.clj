(comment
  ;; This is a simple function mocking library I accidentally wrote as a side
  ;; effect of trying to write an opengl library in clojure. This is loosely
  ;; based on various ruby and java mocking frameworks I have used in the past
  ;; such as mockito, easymock, and whatever rspec uses.
  ;;
  ;; expect uses bindings to wrap the functions that are being tested and
  ;; then validates the invocation count at the end. The expect macro is the
  ;; main entry point and it is given a vector of binding pairs.
  ;; The first of each pair names the dependent function you want to override,
  ;; while the second is a hashmap containing the mock description, usually
  ;; created via the simple helper methods described below.
  ;;
  ;; Usage:
  ;;
  ;; there are one or more dependent functions:
  
  (defn dep-fn1 [] "time consuming calculation in 3rd party library")
  (defn dep-fn2 [x] "function with undesirable side effects while testing")
  
  ;; then we have the code under test that calls these other functions:
  
  (defn my-code-under-test [] (dep-fn1) (dep-fn2 "a") (+ 2 2))

  ;; to test this code, we simply surround it with an expect macro within
  ;; the test:
  
  (expect [dep-fn1 (times 1)
           dep-fn2 (times 1 (has-args [#(= "a" %)]))]
    (my-code-under-test))

  ;; When an expectation fails during execution of the function under test,
  ;; an error condition function is called with the name of the function
  ;; being mocked, the expected form and the actual value. These
  ;; error functions can be overridden to allow easy integration into
  ;; test frameworks such as test-is by reporting errors in the function
  ;; overrides.
